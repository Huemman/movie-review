MY DECK

what - My Deck is a website that shows upcoming movies and a little bit of info about selected movie. 

why - The title of the website is inspired of the deck of cards because the movies on the interface looks like a deck of cards. 

how - The website is created using only the required technologies: Js for functionality of the website's features, HTML so it could run on my browser, and CSS for styling the look of the website. The scripts mostly contain async programming in js and I chose this because the normal convention of getting data from an array of objects is something that I can't wrap my head around. In async programming, you have more control over your errors in case the promise returns in an error.

where - All of the tehniques I used in creating the website was guided by w3schools.com as well as the teachings of my more experienced peers.
